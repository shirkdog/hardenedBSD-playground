the GitHub mirror.

2016-05-30  OpenNTPD 6.0p1

	* Fixed a link failure on older Linux distributions and a build
	  failure on FreeBSD.
	* Set MOD_MAXERROR to avoid unsynced time status when using
	  ntp_adjtime.
	* Fixed HTTP Timestamp header parsing to use strptime in a more
	  portable fashion.
	* Hardened TLS for ntpd constraints, enabling server name
	  verification. Thanks to Luis M. Merino.

2016-03-29  OpenNTPD 5.9p1

	* When a single "constraint" is specified, try all returned addresses
	  until one succeeds, rather than the first returned address.
	* Relaxed the constraint error margin to be proportional to the number
	  of NTP peers, avoid constant reconnections when there is a bad NTP
	  peer.
	* Removed disabled hotplug sensor support.
	* Added support for detecting crashes in constraint subprocesses.
	* Moved the execution of constraints from the ntp process to the
	  parent process, allowing for better privilege separation since the
	  ntp process can be further restricted.
	* Added pledge(2) support.
	* Updated to require LibreSSL 2.3.2 or greater.
	* Fixed high CPU usage when the network is down.
	* Fixed various memory leaks.
	* Switched to RMS for jitter calculations.
	* Unified logging functions with other OpenBSD base programs.

	OpenNTPD portable-specific changes:

	* Added support for syncing time with the Realtime Clock (RTC) on OSes
	  that require it.
	* CFLAGS is no longer overridden by the build system.
	* FreeBSD RTABLE support is disabled
	* FreeBSD is no longer linked with -lmd to avoid hash function
	  collisions, causing failures in constraint certificate loading.
	* Fixed crashes due to __progname being used before initialized.
	* Added Solaris 10 compatibility.
	* Added --disable-https-constraint build option for explicitly
	  disabling constraint support.
	* Synced build system files with LibreSSL

	The libtls library, as shipped with LibreSSL 2.3.2 or later, is
	required to use the HTTPS constraint feature, though it is not
	required to use OpenNTPD.

2015-03-24  OpenNTPD 5.7p4

	* Added support for HTTPS constraints to validate NTP responses.
	  See the man page and example config file for how to configure it.
	  The initial announcement:
	  http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&m=142356166731390&w=2 is an
	  explanation of the rationale and how the feature works.
	* Workaround an apparent bug in Solaris adjtime that cause the clock
	  to report sync/unsync continuously.
	* Workaround an issue on systems with 32-bit time_t that causes an
	  overflow if the system time is later than early 2036.

	The libtls library, as shipped with LibreSSL 2.1.4 or later, is
	required to use the HTTPS constraint feature, though it is not
	required to use OpenNTPD.

2015-01-27  OpenNTPD 5.7p3
	* Fixed issue resolving hostnames when the network is initially
	  unavailable.
	* Fixed process name logging on Linux and OS X.
	* Fixed adjfreq failures on Solaris due to uninitialized struct timex.
	* Support building on Linux musl libc.
	* Default privilege separation directory changed from /var/empty/ntp
	  to /var/empty. Please ensure that if you are using the default from
	  previous releases that the privsep directory is empty, owned by
	  root, and has no write privileges for other users.

2015-01-20  OpenNTPD 5.7p2

	* Switched the drift file from an unscaled frequency offset to ppm.
	  The latter format is compatible with that of ntp.org.  This allows
	  easy switching between ntpd daemons
	* Fixed a memory leak in DNS lookups.
	* Added support for setting the process title on Linux and OS X.
	  The different processes are now possible to tell apart by role in
	  the process list.
	* Import NetBSD support.
	* Various bugfixes and refinements from the community.

2015-01-08  OpenNTPD 5.7p1

	* Support for a new build infrastructure based on the LibreSSL
	  framework. Source code is integrated directly from the OpenBSD tree
	  with few manual changes, easing maintenance.
	* Removed support for several OSes pending test reports and updated
	  portability code.
	* Supports the Simple Network Time Protocol version 4 as described in
	  RFC 5905
	* Added route virtualization (rdomain) support.
	* Added ntpctl(8), which allows for querying ntpd(8) at runtime.
	* Finer-grained clock adjustment via adjfreq / ntp_adjtime where
	  available.
	* Improved latency on heavily-loaded machines.
